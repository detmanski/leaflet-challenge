The link to the map visualization can be found at: https://detmanski.github.io/leaflet-challenge/Leaflet-Part-1/

The relevant code for this challenge is in the Leaflet-Part-1 folder in this repository. 

This challenge asks us to create a visualizaton of earthquakes on a world map. The dataset used to do this was found at the USGS
GeoJSON Feed website. The dataset I chose contains all earthquakes from the past 7 days. 

Using Leaflet, a map  was created that plots all earthquakes in the dataset based of their longitude and latitude. The data 
markers reflet the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 
Earthquakes with higher magnituds appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color. 
When a marker is clicked, a popup show the date/time, magnitude and depth of the earthquake. 

A topographic layer was added to the map. 

Thanks for reading!
